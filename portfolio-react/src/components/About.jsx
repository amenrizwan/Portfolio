        I am a creative and user-focused Computer Science Engineering student with hands-on experience
        in UI/UX design, frontend and backend web development, and freelance project execution. I excel
        at transforming user insights into intuitive and engaging digital interfaces, supported by strong
        skills in Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, and modern web technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        I have managed real-world web development projects, including maintaining and optimizing
        e-commerce websites with responsive layouts, SEO practices, and backend integrations using
        PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. With a strong eye for detail, effective communication skills, and a
        passion for design-driven development, I aim to build meaningful digital experiences that are both
        functional and visually compelling.
